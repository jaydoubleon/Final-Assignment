				<p>The Australian Red Cross Society (ARCS) was formed just after the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, initially as a branch of the British Red Cross Society. The Australian Red Cross Society supports and empowers people and communities in times of vulnerability. Their purpose is to reduce suffering across Australia and internationally through mobilising the power of humanity.
