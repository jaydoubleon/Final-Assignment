				<p><b>We save lives and support people before and after disasters strike. We work to alleviate suffering during wars and conflict and promote the laws of war. And we work to assist our most vulnerable community members â€“ no matter their circumstances.</b>
        <br><br>
        We work with politicians, policy-makers, organisations and the public to improve the situation of the most vulnerable people in Australia and around the world.
        <br><br>
        We advocate based on direct experience and evidence, and empower people to speak out and take action to improve their lives.
        <br><br>
        We will always focus on the needs and perspectives of vulnerable people, in our areas of expertise.
        <br><br>
        We are bound by our Fundamental Principles of Humanity, Impartiality, Neutrality, Independence, Voluntary service, Unity and Universality.

        <p> 
        We won't make any public statements that jeopardise our Principles or the ability for us and our movement partners to continue to alleviate suffering wherever it may be found, in Australia or overseas.
        <br><br>
        We are committed to reconciliation and building an Australia where humanity can thrive. One with a rich identity built on trust, respect and understanding. Where we learn about our shared history and take pride in the histories, cultures and achievements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.
        <br><br>
        <b>Our vision</b>
        <br><br>
        Human dignity, peace, safety and wellbeing for all.
        <br><br>
        <b>Our purpose</b>
        <br><br>
        We support and empower people and communities in times of vulnerability.
        <br><br>
        Our purpose is to reduce suffering across 
        Australia and internationally through mobilising the power of humanity.
